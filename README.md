YouTube Watch Later Automation

Description:
This project automates the extraction and processing of videos from a YouTube "Watch Later" playlist. It uses Selenium WebDriver to control a Firefox browser session, navigate to the playlist, scroll to load all videos, extract video details (title, URL, and uploader), and save this information to a CSV file. The script can also remove videos from the playlist after extraction.


I wrote this script to automate the process of cleaning out my youtube 
watch later playlist but I wanted to also be able to save those videos 
to rewatch later in case I needed to revisit. I hope this is as useful 
to you as it has been for me! I welcome any advice you have.
