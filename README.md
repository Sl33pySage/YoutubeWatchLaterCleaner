I wrote this script to automate the process of cleaning out my youtube watch later playlist but I wanted to also be able to save those videos to rewatch later in case I needed to revisit. I hope this is as useful to you as it has been for me! I welcome any advice you have.

This script essentially uses selenium (I prefer using firefox but you can configure selenium to use whatever you like) to attach to your current browser profile as a way to "manually login" and navigates to your watch later playlist, copying the video data to a csv file and then clearing out your watch later playlist.
